Adapter design pattern is one of the structural design pattern and its used
so that two unrelated interfaces can work together. The object that joins
these unrelated interface is called an Adapter.

One of the great real life example of Adapter design pattern is mobile charger.
Mobile battery needs 3 volts to charge but the normal socket produces either 120V (US) or 240V (India).
So the mobile charger works as an adapter between mobile charging socket and the wall socket.

Adapter Design Pattern Example in JDK
Some of the adapter design pattern example I could easily find in JDK classes are;

java.util.Arrays#asList()
java.io.InputStreamReader(InputStream) (returns a Reader)
java.io.OutputStreamWriter(OutputStream) (returns a Writer)
